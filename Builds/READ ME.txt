To access custom levels to share with friends, navigate to your AppData.
WindowsKey + R and enter "%appdata%
There will be a folder titled "VR RC Racing" and within that folder, another
named "Levels."
Simply share the .txt file with a friend and they can play your level also.
To load a custom level, drag a .txt file from a friend's "Levels" folder
and in game type the name of the level and click "Load."
If there are no errors with the level's syntax, the level should load with
little to no bugs.

**As this is a new feature, there are still bugs that need to be fixed.
While you are able to share tracks with friends, some track pieces may need
to be fixed in the editor before being able to play the track as intended.**
